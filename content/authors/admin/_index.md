Sarah Leidinger's house has been overrun by ants. The effort to control their has only encouraged them. Every cup, every corner, every crevice is occupied by the squishable fiends. Like spies they covertly traverse the ceiling of the BIG ROOM to hover just above me. Without warning they reach back towards the ground landing in my hair, my glasses, my eyelashes. This offensive has been ongoing for the better part of a month and each day it wears down my sanity. ALAS! There is one thing this tireless horde cannot take from me: this website. Please allow this space to immortalize me long after I've succumbed to the 6-legged devils.
